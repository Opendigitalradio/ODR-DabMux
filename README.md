Overview
========

ODR-DabMux is a *DAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting) multiplexer* compliant to
ETSI EN 300 401. It is the continuation of the work started by the
Communications Research Center Canada on CRC-DabMux, and is now pursued in the
[Opendigitalradio project](http://opendigitalradio.org).

ODR-DabMux is part of the ODR-mmbTools tool set. More information about the
ODR-mmbTools is available in the *guide*, available on the
[Opendigitalradio mmbTools page](http://www.opendigitalradio.org/mmbtools).

Features of ODR-DabMux:

- Standards-compliant DAB multiplexer
- Configuration file, see doc/example.mux
- Timestamping support required for SFN
- ZeroMQ and TCP ETI outputs that can be used with ODR-DabMod
- ZeroMQ input that can be used with ODR-AudioEnc
  which supports CURVE authentication
- Experimental STI-D(PI, X)/RTP input intended to be compatible
  with compliant encoders.
- Logging to syslog
- Monitoring using munin tool
- Includes a Telnet and ZMQ Remote Control for setting/getting parameters
- EDI output
- Support for FarSync TE1 and TE1e cards (G.703)
- Something that will (with your help?) one day become a nice GUI for
  configuration, see `gui/README.md`

Additional tools: `odr-zmq2edi`, a tool that can convert a ZeroMQ ETI stream
to an EDI stream. `odr-zmq2farsync`, a tool that can drive a FarSync card from
a ZeroMQ ETI stream.

The `src/` directory contains the source code of ODR-DabMux and the additional
tools.

The `doc/` directory contains the ODR-DabMux documentation, a few example
configuration files, and the munin and xymon scripts for the statistics server.

The `lib/` directory contains source code of libraries needed to build
ODR-DabMux.
