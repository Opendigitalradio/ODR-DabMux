; This is an example configuration file that illustrates
; the structure of the configuration.
; It doesn't show all possible options. A more detailed example

;
; It contains two services, one DAB and one DAB+, and also shows
; both the file input useful for offline processing, and the
; ZeroMQ input useful in a 24/7 scenario.

; More information about the usage of the tools is available
; in the guide, which can be found on the
; www.opendigitalradio.org website.
;
; As you can see, comments are defined by semicolons.
;
; It consists of six mandatory sections, whose relative order in this
; file are of no importance.

; The general section defines global multiplex parameters.
general {
    ; the DAB Transmission mode (values 1-4 accepted)
    dabmode 1

    ; the number of ETI frames to generate (set to 0 to get an unlimited number)
    nbframes 10

    ; boolean fields can accept either false or true as values:

    ; Set to true to enable logging to syslog
    syslog false

    ; Enable timestamp definition necessary for SFN
    ; This also enables time encoding using the MNSC.
    ;
    ; When TIST is enabled, and either EDI or a ZMQ output with metadata is used,
    ; ODR-DabMux will download leap-second information from the IETF website,
    ; and cache it locally in /var/tmp. It will refresh the data by itself
    ; before it expires.
    ;
    ; If it cannot load this information, ODR-DabMux cannot start up!
    ;
    ; If your system doesn't have access to internet, you have to take care
    ; to create the file before ODR-DabMux startup. Get it from
    ; http://www.ietf.org/timezones/data/leap-seconds.list
    ; and save it to
    ; /var/tmp/odr-dabmux-leap-seconds.cache
    ; Refresh the file before expiry otherwise ODR-DabMux will abort!
    ;
    ; Use the RC interface 'get clocktai expiry' command to check how long
    ; your file is still valid.
    tist false

    ; The URLs used to fetch the TAI bulletin can be overridden if needed.
    ; URLs are given as a pipe-separated list, and the default value is:
    ;tai_clock_bulletins "https://www.ietf.org/timezones/data/leap-seconds.list|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eggert/tz/master/leap-seconds.list"
    ;
    ; You may also use a file:// URL if you take care of updating the file
    ; yourself and store it locally.

    ; The management server is a simple TCP server that can present
    ; statistics data (buffers, overruns, underruns, etc)
    ; which can then be graphed a tool like Munin
    ; The doc/stats_dabmux_multi.py tool is a suitable
    ; plugin for that.
    ; If the port is zero, or the line commented, the server
    ; is not started.

    ; This server allows you to read and define parameters that
    ; some features export. It is only accessible from localhost.

    telnetport 12721

    ; The remote control is also accessible through a ZMQ REQ/REP socket,
    ; and is useful for machine-triggered interactions. It supports the
    ; same commands as the telnet RC.
    ; The example code in doc/zmq_remote.py illustrates how to use this rc.
    ; To disable the zeromq endpoint, remove the zmqendpoint line.
    ; By specifying "lo" in the URL, we make the server only accessible
    ; from localhost. You can write tcp://*:12722 to make it accessible
    ; on all interfaces.

    ; represented in EBU Latin will be replaced by a space character.
