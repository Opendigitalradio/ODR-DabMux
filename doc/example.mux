; This is an example configuration file that illustrates
; the structure of the configuration.
; It doesn't show all possible options. A more detailed example
; is available in doc/advanced.mux
;
; It contains two services, one DAB and one DAB+, and also shows
; both the file input useful for offline processing, and the
; ZeroMQ input useful in a 24/7 scenario.

; More information about the usage of the tools is available
; in the guide, which can be found on the
; www.opendigitalradio.org website.
;
; As you can see, comments are defined by semicolons.
;
; It consists of six mandatory sections, whose relative order in this
; file are of no importance.

; The general section defines global multiplex parameters.
general {
    ; the DAB Transmission mode (values 1-4 accepted)
    dabmode 1

    ; the number of ETI frames to generate (set to 0 to get an unlimited number)
    nbframes 10

    ; boolean fields can accept either false or true as values:

    ; Enable logging to syslog
    syslog false

    ; Enable timestamp definition necessary for SFN
    ; This also enables time encoding using the MNSC.
    tist false

    ; The management server is a simple TCP server that can present
    ; statistics data (buffers, overruns, underruns, etc)
    ; which can then be graphed a tool like Munin
    ; The doc/stats_dabmux_multi.py tool is a suitable
    ; plugin for that.
    ; If the port is zero, or the line commented, the server
    ; is not started.
    managementport 12720
}

remotecontrol {
    ; enable the telnet remote control server on the given port
    ; This server allows you to read and define parameters that
    ; some features export. It is only accessible from localhost.
    ; Set the port to 0 to disable the server
    telnetport 12721

    ; the remote control server makes use of the unique identifiers
    ; for the subchannels, services and components. Make sure you
    ; chose them so that you can identify them.
}

; Some ensemble parameters
ensemble {
    id 0x4fff ; you can also use decimal if you want
    ecc 0xec ; Extended Country Code

    local-time-offset auto  ; autmatically calculate from system local time
                            ; or
    ;local-time-offset 1    ; in hours, supports half-hour offsets

    ; all labels are maximum 16 characters in length
    label "OpenDigitalRadio"
    ; The short label is built from the label by erasing letters, and cannot
    ; be longer than 8 characters. If omitted, it will be truncated from the
    ; label
    shortlabel "ODR"
}

; Definition of DAB services
services {
    ; Each service has it's own unique identifier, that is
    ; used throughout the configuration file and for the RC.
    srv-fu {
        label "Funk"
        ; you can define a shortlabel too.
    }
    srv-ri {
        label "Rick"
    }
}

subchannels {
    sub-fu {
        ; This is our DAB programme, using a file input
        type audio
        inputfile "funk.mp2"
        bitrate 128
        id 10
    }
    sub-ri {
        ; This is our DAB+ programme, using a ZeroMQ
        type dabplus
        ; Accepts connections to port 9000 from any interface.
        ; Use FDK-AAC-DABplus as encoder
        inputfile "tcp://*:9000"
        bitrate 96
        id 1

        ; ZMQ specific options, mandatory:

        ; Maximum size of input buffer, in AAC frames (24ms)
        ; when this buffer size is reached, some frames will be
        ; discarded to get the size again below this value.
        ; As the present implementation discards entire AAC superframes,
        ; (5 frames = 120ms) the effect will clearly be audible.
        zmq-buffer 40

        ; At startup or after an underrun, the buffer is filled to this
        ; amount of AAC frames before streaming starts.
        zmq-prebuffering 20

        ; In an ideal scenario, where the input rate exactly corresponds
        ; to the rate at which the frames are consumed by dabmux, you
        ; see the buffer level staying around the zmq-prebuffering value.
        ; Network latency jitter can make it temporarily go lower or higher.
        ; Encoder clock drift will make the buffer either slowly fill or
        ; empty, which will create intermittent glitches.
    }
}

; In our simple example, each component links one service to one subchannel
components {
    ; the component unique identifiers are used for the RC.
    comp-fu {
        ; According to specification, you should not define component labels if
        ; the service is only used in one component. The service label is sufficient
        ; in that case.
        service srv-fu
        subchannel sub-fu

        service srv-ri

; A list of outputs
outputs {
    ; The unique-id can be used by the remote control or the statistics server
    ; to identify the output

    ; Output RAW ETI NI to standard output
    stdout "fifo:///dev/stdout?type=raw"

    ; ZeroMQ output example
    ; Listen on all interfaces, on port 9100
    ;zmq  "zmq+tcp://*:9100"

    ; Throttle output to real-time (one ETI frame every 24ms)
    ;throttle "simul://"

    ; Important! For real-time operation, you need to have exactly one
    ; output that applies back-pressure to ODR-DabMux, otherwise it will run
    ; at the highest possible rate on your system!
    ;
    ; For an output to a pipe, the data consumer at the other end of the pipe
    ; will dictate the multiplexing rate to ODR-DabMux.
    ;
    ; If you use the zmq output, you must also enable a simul:// output!
