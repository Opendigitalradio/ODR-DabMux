.SH NAME
\fBodr\-dabmux\fR \- A software DAB multiplexer
.SH SYNOPSIS
odr\-dabmux <configuration_file>
.PP
This software requires a configuration file. See doc/example.config for an example format for the configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
odr\-dabmux implements a DAB multiplexer that combines all audio and data
inputs into an ETI output. It can be used off-line (i.e. not real-time) to generate
ETI data for later processing, or in a real-time streaming scenario (e.g. in a
transmitter).
.PP
odr\-dabmux can read input audio or data from files (".mp2" for DAB, ".dabp"
for DAB+), FIFOs (also called "named pipes"), or from a network connection. This
network connection can use UDP (STI-D) or EDI.
.PP
The configuration of the multiplexer is given in a configuration file, whose
format is defined in the example files in the doc/ folder inside the ODR-DabMux
repository.
